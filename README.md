# Vashudevan Met Global LLP - Corporate Website\n\nThis is the official corporate website for Vashudevan Met Global LLP, built with Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The site is designed to be a fast, SEO-optimized, and fully static portfolio.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 App Router, React Server Components.\n- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Blazing-fast performance by default (`output: \'export\`).\n- **SEO First**: Automatic sitemap generation, `robots.txt`, JSON-LD structured data, and per-page metadata.\n- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS.\n- **Image Optimization**: Uses `next/image` principles (though unoptimized for static export).\n- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and focus management.\n- **Contact Form**: Server-side validation with a mock API handler.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js (v18.17 or later)\n- npm, yarn, or pnpm\n\n### Installation\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd vashudevan-met-global\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Set up environment variables:**\n    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:\n    ```bash\n    cp .env.example .env.local\n    ```\n    The `MAIL_TO_ADDRESS` is used as a placeholder for the contact form.\n\n### Running the Development Server\n\nTo start the development server, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\n## Building for Production\n\nTo create a production-ready static build, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis command will:\n1.  Build the Next.js application into the `.next/` directory.\n2.  Export the application to static HTML/CSS/JS files in the `out/` directory.\n3.  Run `next-sitemap` to generate `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` in the `out/` directory.\n\nThe `out/` directory is ready to be deployed to any static hosting service.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThis project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**, but can be hosted on any static hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages, AWS S3).\n\n### Deploying to Vercel\n\n1.  Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).\n2.  Import the project into Vercel.\n3.  Vercel will automatically detect that you are using Next.js.\n4.  Configure the **Build & Development Settings**:\n    - **Framework Preset**: Next.js\n    - **Build Command**: `npm run build`\n    - **Output Directory**: `out` (because we are using `output: \'export\'`)\n5.  Add any environment variables if needed.\n6.  Click **Deploy**.\n\n## Lighthouse Optimization Notes\n\nThis site is built with performance as a top priority.\n\n- **Core Web Vitals**: By using SSG, Server Components, and optimized images (when configured), the site should achieve excellent Core Web Vitals scores.\n- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: The hero image on the homepage is a primary candidate for LCP. Ensure it is properly sized and compressed. Preload critical fonts and images if necessary.\n- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: All images should have explicit `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shifts. The current setup with `next/image` principles helps, but for static export, ensure aspect ratios are maintained.\n- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Minimal client-side JavaScript ensures the main thread is not blocked, leading to a low FID.\n- **Image Formats**: Serve images in modern formats like WebP or AVIF. The `scripts/optimize-images.md` file contains notes on how to batch-optimize images for the web.\n

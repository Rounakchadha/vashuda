  mission: `Our mission is to be a catalyst for positive change in the global recycling industry, where sustainability and business objectives work hand in hand. Trading and logistics are at the core of what we do, and we play an essential role in moving scrap metal from regions where it is available to the regions where it is needed most — reliably, efficiently and responsibly. Recycling metals significantly reduces the energy and resources needed compared to raw material production. For instance, recycling steel uses 60 percent less energy, while recycling aluminium saves an incredible 95 percent of the energy required to produce it from raw ore. Every container of scrap we move helps conserve energy and protect the environment. At Vashudevan MetGlobal LLP, our commitment is clear, to create a better, greener future for the generations to come, one container at a time.`,
  impact: `At Vashudevan MetGlobal LLP, we believe recycling metal is one of the most powerful ways to create positive change for both the economy and the environment. Metal is one of the few materials that can be reused over and over again without losing its properties — making it an essential part of building a more sustainable world. From soda cans to ships and semi trucks, more than 150 million tons of scrap metal are recycled each year in the United States alone. According to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), metal recycling can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 300 to 500 million tons annually. The Northeast Recycling Council reports that recycling steel leads to an 86% reduction in air pollution, 76% reduction in water pollution, and 40% less water used compared to virgin production — while generating 97% less mining waste.`,

    title: 'Why Recycling Metals Matters',
    points: [
      { title: 'Preserving Natural Resources', text: `The global scrap metal network is like a series of “above ground mines,” rich with resources that can be reused at a fraction of the cost of mining and refining virgin ore. Recycling metal significantly reduces the demand for coal and iron ore — key resources in metal production — and helps prevent unnecessary extraction that damages ecosystems. Since coal combustion accounts for a major share of global greenhouse gas emissions, every ton of recycled metal helps fight climate change and conserve valuable natural resources.` },
      { title: 'Reducing Energy Consumption', text: `Recycling metal uses dramatically less energy than producing new metal from raw ore. For example, recycling aluminum saves up to 95% of the energy required for primary production. Using iron and steel scrap reduces carbon emissions by nearly 58%, according to ISRI. Lower energy usage means fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint — a direct benefit to the planet.` },
      { title: 'Driving Economic Growth', text: `Scrap recycling is not just an environmental initiative — it is a major economic driver. Our work supports a global value chain that turns scrap into a revenue stream for industries, manufacturers, and individuals. According to ISRI, the scrap recycling industry supports more than 470,000 good-paying jobs and generates over $105 billion in annual economic activity worldwide. For manufacturers, recycled metal offers a cost-effective alternative to newly mined ore, lowering production costs and enabling competitive pricing on consumer goods like automobiles, appliances, and packaging — savings that ultimately benefit end customers.` },
      { title: 'Other Environmental Benefits', text: `By recycling steel, aluminum, copper and other metals, we keep these valuable materials out of landfills, reducing harmful leachate and pollution. Minimizing landfill waste, reducing mining activity, and lowering energy consumption all contribute to cleaner air, cleaner water, and a healthier environment for future generations.` },
    ],
    conclusion: `At Vashudevan MetGlobal LLP, every container of scrap we trade is a step toward a more sustainable and responsible world, proving that profitability and environmental stewardship can go hand in hand.`
